# Changelog

## [v1.9.7-preview] — 2026-07-09

### Bug Fixes
- Fix world login pipeline: login-critical opcodes (AUTH_CHALLENGE, AUTH_RESPONSE, CHAR_ENUM, CHAR_CREATE, CHAR_DELETE, WARDEN_DATA) now fall back to hardcoded wire values when opcode table lookup fails, preventing "Unhandled world opcode: 0x1ec" blocking character list retrieval (issue #87)
- OpcodeTable::loadFromJson() now loads into temporaries and only swaps on success — a failed reload no longer wipes the working table
- Integrity hash is now build-aware: Classic-era DLLs (fmod.dll, ijl15.dll, dbghelp.dll, unicows.dll) only required for builds <=6005 or Turtle; TBC/WotLK clients hash only the .exe

### Animation & Camera
- Rework strafing to use walk/run animations with SpineLow bone torso twist instead of dedicated strafe/run-left/right animations
- Add `setInstanceTorsoYaw()` to CharacterRenderer for per-instance upper-body rotation
- Camera smoothing snaps 1:1 while actively dragging or keyboard turning instead of always lerping, reducing perceived input lag
- Add `travelYaw_` tracker to CameraController for movement vector heading separate from camera facing
- Mount strafing uses MOUNT_RUN_LEFT/RIGHT animations when available
- Default mouse invert changed to off

### Tests
- Add "OpcodeTable failed reload preserves existing data" test case
